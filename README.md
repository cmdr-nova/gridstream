I was musing about how it's a shame there are so many feed reading apps that are just trying to get you to subscribe to premium services, such as, making folders. So, I made a feed reader app. It's already packaged in a zip for you to download, but, if you'd like to modify it and build it yourself, that's possible!

Install the dependencies, and then build.
```
$ pyinstaller GridStream.spec
```
App utilizes sqlalchemy, python, feedparser, & flask.
